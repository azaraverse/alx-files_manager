# FILES MANAGER
This repository contains JavaScript code for a files manager application.

## TASKS

### 0. Redis
Inside the folder utils, create a file `redis.js` that contains the class `RedisClient`.

`RedisClient` should have:

- the constructor that creates a client to Redis:
- - any error of the redis client must be displayed in the console (you should use `on('error')` of the redis client)
- a function `isAlive` that returns `true` when the connection to Redis is a success otherwise, `false`
- an asynchronous function `get` that takes a string key as argument and returns the Redis value stored for this key
- an asynchronous function `set` that takes a string key, a value and a duration in second as arguments to store it in Redis (with an expiration set by the duration argument)
- an asynchronous function `del` that takes a string key as argument and remove the value in Redis for this key
After the class definition, create and export an instance of `RedisClient` called `redisClient`.
